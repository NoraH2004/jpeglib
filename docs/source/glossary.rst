JPEG sampling factor
""""""""""""""""""""

As human eyes are better in seeing light intensity (*luminance*) than colors (*chrominance*),
chrominance is another component that can be reduced with so called chroma subsampling.
It is controlled using sampling factors, a pair of integer numbers per each channel,
3 pairs for YCbCr, `[[h1,w1],[h2,w2],[h3,w3]]`.

Let's have an example: an RGB image with 300px x 300px and sampling factors [[2,3],[1,2],[2,1]].
What we want is the resolution of channels YCbCr stored in JPEG. We start with computing
hmax and wmax (2 and 3) and normalizing factors with the respective maximum; now we have
[[1,1],[1/2,2/3],[1,1/3]], which stands for how large are sides compared to a rectangle 2x3 pixels.
Thus multiplied by the image size, Y has 300 x 300, Cb 150 x 200 and Cr 300 x 100.
